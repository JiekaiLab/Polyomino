# STARmap Usage Guide

For spatial transcriptomics platforms with single-cell resolution such as STARmap, please refer to the main usage instructions provided here:  
https://github.com/JiekaiLab/Polyomino/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#usage

In brief, since STARmap data is already at single-cell resolution, Polyomino can directly utilize the original spatial coordinates without additional spatial binning. It is recommended to prepare a matched scRNA-seq reference with overlapping genes for optimal integration.

Please see the repository for detailed example scripts and parameter settings.
